         <p class="text">In his regular BBC Sport column, Robbie Savage looks at Aston Villa's 3-0 defeat by
            Manchester United on Sunday.
         </p>
         		
         <p class="text">There has been a lot of criticism of United in recent weeks, so their manager David
            Moyes deserves credit for getting things right at Villa Park. A number of their players
            can take real positives away from the game.
         </p>
         		
         <p class="text">But it helped Moyes a lot that Villa were so poor in pretty much every area of the
            pitch. In fact, they were awful.
