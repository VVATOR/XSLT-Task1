         <p class="text">In his regular BBC Sport column, Robbie Savage looks at Aston Villa's 3-0 defeat by
            Manchester United on Sunday.
         </p>
         
         <p class="text">There has been a lot of criticism of United in recent weeks, so their manager David
            Moyes deserves credit for getting things right at Villa Park. A number of their players
            can take real positives away from the game.
         </p>
         
         <p class="text">But it helped Moyes a lot that Villa were so poor in pretty much every area of the
            pitch. In fact, they were awful.

      <div class="qa-block">
         
         <div class="question">Under Paul Lambert, Villa's home form is terrible. They have only scored six times
            in eight home league games this season, and have lost five of them.
         </div>
         
         <div class="answer">Why are they so bad? Well, every other pundit I listen to knows they are a counter-attacking
            side and other teams seem to have worked them out too. United definitely did.
         </div>
         
         <div class="question">Villa actually made a pretty good start on Sunday. They had six shots in the first
            five minutes and looked quite dangerous.
         </div>
         
         <div class="answer">But that all changed as soon as Danny Welbeck scored twice in quick succession.</div>
         
         <div class="question">From then on, United were in control of the game and Rafael and Antonio Valencia tore
            Luna apart.
         </div>
         
         <div class="answer">Almost half of their attacks came down that third of the pitch, while Wayne Rooney
            dropped deep and started spraying passes out wide too.

                        <li>Born in Nelson in 1882, the former Burnley, Fulham, Swindon and Bolton inside-forward
                           was in his early 30s when he took charge of Budapest club MTK in 1914, introducing
                           a brand of football that was to become known as "the Danubian
                           Style" and sparking a national obsession with the game in a country where it had previously
                           been largely ignored.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>He briefly came home in 1918, where he was called a traitor by the Football Association
                           for working abroad during the war, before embarking on a tour of Europe that saw him
                           coach in Switzerland, Germany and back in Budapest
                           during the 1920s. He helped Switzerland reach the final of the 1926 Olympics and more
                           titles with MTK followed.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>It was in the 1930s that he began to be appreciated by a wider audience, working with
                           Hugo Meisl's legendary Austrian national side during a period when they were known
                           as the 'Wunderteam' before being appointed Fulham manager
                           in 1934.
