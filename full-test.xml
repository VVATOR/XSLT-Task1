        <para type="text">In his regular BBC Sport column, Robbie Savage looks at Aston Villa's 3-0 defeat by Manchester United on Sunday.</para>
        <para type="text">There has been a lot of criticism of United in recent weeks, so their manager David Moyes deserves credit for getting things right at Villa Park. A number of their players can take real positives away from the game.</para>
        <para type="text">But it helped Moyes a lot that Villa were so poor in pretty much every area of the pitch. In fact, they were awful.</para>

        <question>Under Paul Lambert, Villa's home form is terrible. They have only scored six times in eight home league games this season, and have lost five of them.</question>
        <answer>Why are they so bad? Well, every other pundit I listen to knows they are a counter-attacking side and other teams seem to have worked them out too. United definitely did.</answer>
        <question>Villa actually made a pretty good start on Sunday. They had six shots in the first five minutes and looked quite dangerous.</question>
        <answer>But that all changed as soon as Danny Welbeck scored twice in quick succession.</answer>
        <question>From then on, United were in control of the game and Rafael and Antonio Valencia tore Luna apart.</question>
        <answer>Almost half of their attacks came down that third of the pitch, while Wayne Rooney dropped deep and started spraying passes out wide too.</answer>

                            <list-item>Born in Nelson in 1882, the former Burnley, Fulham, Swindon and Bolton inside-forward was in his early 30s when he took charge of Budapest club MTK in 1914, introducing a brand of football that was to become known as "the Danubian
                                Style" and sparking a national obsession with the game in a country where it had previously been largely ignored.</list-item>
                            <list-item>He briefly came home in 1918, where he was called a traitor by the Football Association for working abroad during the war, before embarking on a tour of Europe that saw him coach in Switzerland, Germany and back in Budapest
                                during the 1920s. He helped Switzerland reach the final of the 1926 Olympics and more titles with MTK followed.</list-item>
                            <list-item>It was in the 1930s that he began to be appreciated by a wider audience, working with Hugo Meisl's legendary Austrian national side during a period when they were known as the 'Wunderteam' before being appointed Fulham manager
                                in 1934.</list-item>
